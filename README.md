<h1 align="center">BonkMC Launcher</h1>

<em><h5 align="center">(Forked from Helios Launcher which was formerly Electron Launcher)</h5></em>

This project is for BonkMC's Client Side Anticheat, which is coming soon, and will also work with BonkMLAC. It currently only acts as a friendly and simple launcher for BonkMC (ServerIP: play.bonkmc.net).

This project is not open source for the integrity of the anti-cheat.
